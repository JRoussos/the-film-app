# The film app

This is a web app with minimalistic design, that lets you search for a movie or series and shows you some info about them. 

I used the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to obtain the movie information.

### But why?
The reason for this project was to familiarize myself with the animation platform [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) and practice on my ReactJS skills

#### So What I learned 
- The basics of GSAP
- How to create modals with the use of react router
- Better understanding on React Hooks 

### The packages

- [react-hook-form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form)
- [react-infinite-scroller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroller)
- [gsap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gsap)
- [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
